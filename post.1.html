            <p> All opinions are my own, this is based off my experience, and information may be out dated or just actually wrong. I’ll set up a contact form at some point and you can correct me if it upsets you enough. </p> 
            <p> I’ve tried to keep each topic brief. If you want to learn more, real information, may I suggest you visit google. </p>
              
            <h2 class="section-heading">Speech</h2>
            <p> I think I took speech for granted until I studied it.</p>
            <p>For example, how many vowels are there? 5? According to the Latin alphabet there are, but if in terms of the sounds we make when we talk, it’s more like 20, and there’s more like 24 consonants.</p>
            <p>With some accents the sounds are distinct to others. We just kind of map them on the ones that we use.</p>
            <p>An examples of this is with the Liverpudlian accent, the "k" sound in "back" isn't the same k as other British accents, but your brain thinks it is, but just weird version of it.</p>
            </p>It’s why I think the brain is cool. You can hear a bunch of sounds you’ve never heard in your life, from someone with a completely alien accent to yours and in a fraction of a second figure out that yes, they also think this weather is rubbish.</p>        
            <h2 class="section-heading">Steering</h2>
            <p>I've been lucky enough to drive, sail and fly things. The land steering is the most simple, it’s all 2D. The stuff (ground) underneath you isn’t moving and the direction you aim to go in, is normally the direction you end up going. </p>
            <p>At sea, the stuff (water) underneath you is doing its own thing dragging you about with it and you’re probably being pushed by wind. The direction you want to go in has to take into account these things. </p>
            <p>In the air, it all becomes a bit insane. You are being pushed around by a variable and invisible force. To top it off, the amount you tilt up or down (pitch) affects your speed and if you really get it wrong you can stall the thing and end up hurling towards the ground. </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Code magic</h2>
            <p>I did a Computer Science masters, but I did an undergrad (bachelors) in something a bit like speech and language therapy.</p>
            <p>I ended up in this world-wind year of feeling like I had to learn everthing about computing that most people have 3 years to learn. Here's a taste:</p>
            <p>Computers need 'machine readable' code, which might look a bit like "AB F2 45 8F 3C". If I wanted my website to have some text like this: <font color="0000FF">HELLOOO</font>, then writing in that way would be awful, time-consuming and hugely error prone. So there are layers of coding languages.</p>
            <p>I am writing in HTML, but even just from my laptop this information needs to be broken down into tiny transmitable bits of information and sent wirelessly and securely to my router. From here it has to reach Firebase who host my site, where it is reassembled and then public - all in a few minutes.
            <p>It actually blows my mind as an example of amazing human collaboration. I could write more on this, but I'm trying to keep it simple and non-technical!</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Hockey (of the field variety)</h2>
            <p>I started playing hockey in August 2016, having only played in school and once a year at uni. I did it to meet people and because I hate the gym.</p>
            <p>Nearly 2 years later I can run faster than I ever could before. I have hand-eye coordination I didn't think would ever be possible. I also have some really great friends (aww).</p>
            <p>One rule that you can't hit the ball up if a player is too close, the only time that is not applicable is when they are making a shot of goal.</p>
            <p>I play in defence but to-date there has only been one time when I've shut my eyes and hoped it didn't hit me in the face. Generally there's quite low contact from other players. We play some teams who are really aggressive/petty and I mostly just feel sorry for them that they think that is what hockey is.</p>
            <p>To me, it's a game of the brain as much as the body. If I can predict from previous behaviour what the opposition is going to do I get an advantage. If I can communicate well and know where my team are then I can pass the ball faster. Naturally, a lot of that goes out of the window in the heat of a game though.</p>
